# UnityRLBridge
UnityRLBridge is a package developed for the use of Unity environments in reinforcement learning applications, featuring multi-agent and environment support, and it has ease of use.. With this package, you can quickly and easily connect to a pre-made Unity environment and train your agents through this environment.
## Usage
The UnityRLBridge package operates with a server on the Unity side and one or more clients on the Python side. Each agent on the Unity side has two components of type text named `behavior_name` and `agent_name`. In contrast, each client on the Python side has one component of type text named `behavior_name`. Below is a detailed description of these components.
### behavior_name & agent_name
`behavior_name` represents a name for agents with the same type of behavior. On the other hand, `agent_name` is a name given to represent a specific agent. To illustrate with an example: Let's assume we have multiple agents in an environment, and these agents are all dogs. In this case, our `behavior_name` component would be `Dog`, and the `agent_name` component would be the name of the respective dog, such as `Max`.

In Unity, the `behavior_name` and `agent_name` components are nested under the AgentBehavior class.
```
string behavior_name = agent_behavior.behavior_name;
string agent_name = agent_behavior.agent_name;
```

On the Python side, the `behavior_name` component is located under the Bridge class. For agents with the corresponding `behavior_name` component on the Python side, their `agent_names` components are stored as a list under the `agent_names` attribute under the Bridge class.
```
behavior_name = bridge.behavior_name
agent_name = bridge.agent_names[agent_index]
```

### Unity Side ###
To use the RLBridge package in Unity, first create an empty GameObject, and then add the `Bridge.cs` script to this GameObject. Below are some features described for the Bridge script.

`agents` You need to add the agents present in your scene to this section for the bridge to access them.

`Ip` `Port` Represents the IP address and port where the listening will occur.

`timeScale` It serves to change the flow speed of the simulation. (1 is normal flow speed)

`maxClients` It represents the maximum number of clients that can connect to the simulation environment.

`numClients` It represents the number of clients connected to the simulation environment.

`BeginEnv()` Starts the simulation. Should be executed after all clients have connected.

To create an agent in the Unity environment, create a new script and include the RLBridge namespace in the script. Inherit the class in the script from the AgentBehavior class and override the relevant methods. 

```
using UnityEngine;
using RLBridge;

public class YourAgentScript : AgentBehavior
{
    // Override methods from AgentBehavior class
}
```

Below are the details of the AgentBehavior
